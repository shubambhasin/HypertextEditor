## How to use HyperText Editor ï¿½
- Click on ```B``` to Bold the text
- Click on ```I``` to Bold the text
- Click on ```U``` to Bold the text
- Click on the ```link``` button to convert selected text into a link and there an unlink button appears after you select a link, click on it and the link will be removed
- To add a ```meme``` a format is needed i.e., {{cat_meme}}, here 'cat' is the name of the meme and rest ```_meme``` is the format so use it like that.
- To add image from the link press on ```image``` icon and enter the url in the modal and hit enter/ add button image will be added, for deleting the same you need to click the image and press delete/backspace from the keyboard.

**Note** 
Add link and add image via URL models supports closing of modals on mouseOut to save you an extra click. That means as soon as the mouse move out of the modal, modal will be closed. So keep that in mind.
